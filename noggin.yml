- - Why is some eyesight worse than others?
  - Bad eyesight can happen because of a number of things. The most common eyesight problem is nearsightedness, this is a common vision condition in which you can see objects near to you clearly, but objects farther away are blurry. It occurs when the shape of your eye causes light rays to bend incorrectly, focusing images in front of your retina instead of on your retina. Nearsightedness may develop gradually or rapidly, often worsening during childhood and adolescence. However, farsightedness, the opposite of nearsighted; develops in eyes that focus images behind the retina instead of on the retina, which can result in blurred vision. This occurs when the eyeball is too short, which prevents incoming light from focusing directly on the retina. It may also be caused by an abnormal shape of the cornea or lens. These are both hereditary and can happen to anyone and worsen anytime because of the shape/size of your eye.

  - we descended from monkeys 
- - why dose the moon rotate around the earth
  - the moon rotates around the earth due to gravitational pull. the earth put enough gravity on the moon to keep it near and spinning. the moon helps determine the tides and night time. if the moon did not rotate then we would not have night and the tides would be crazy. in conclusion. the moon rotates the earth to keep things in line and because the earth has a gravitational pull on it.

- - what allows us to see color?
  - Light receptors within the eye transmit messages to the brain, which produces the familiar sensations of color.
- - Why is water clear?
  - pure water is clear because it is a liquid, objects that are not clear either scatter light due to a difference in refractive index between air and the substance or they absorb all the photons at the wavelength you are observing. but if the water had something in to make it not so pure it it would be a different story

  - pressure is what makes things get dull the friction and pressure happens when the sharp thing is in use. the blade will become wider and more round with friction and pressure. 
- - Does gas float?
  - Yes gas does float because it is less dense than water.
- - Why do men grow hair on there faces but women do not?
  - This is because of a hormone called dihydrotestosterone, or DHT. Men have hair follicles on their jaw which are very sensitive to DHT. Women also have hair follicles on their face, but women's follicles are less sensitive to DHT.
- - is metal good heat shielded 
  - metals are good shields to heat. If the main way that heat is being transported in a particular system is through thermal radiation, then metals are excellent heat shields. if a metal is in direct contact with a hot object, it will quickly carry heat away from the object.

  - rotation is when you move something and revolution is when you are revolving something. 
- - how are rainbows made 
  - The sun makes rainbows when white sunlight passes through raindrops. The raindrops act like tiny prisms. They bend the different colors in white light, so the light spreads out into a band of colors that can be reflected back to you as a rainbow.
- - can you shatter glass with your voice? if so why/ how does that work?
  - Sound is vibration in waves, and the deeper the pitch, the further apart the waves are and the higher the pitch the closer the sound waves are, all objects have a natural frequency when hit, or plucked. If a sound is pitched enough and it's loud enough that same frequency, it can shatter it, glass is a crystal and it's easier to shatter with this. See more on this here

  - A blobfish is made out of type of gelatin that is a little bit more dense than water. They're kind of like a water balloon, floating around, waiting for food to come to them. 
- - Where can you find a neutron?
  - Neutrons are found in the nucleus of an atom. 
- - Why are we running out of helium?
  - Helium is so light that it does not stay in our atmosphere. We find helium while digging for oil. The people digging for oil will hit pockets of helium and will trap the air. We are using helium faster than what the earth can make. Because of this, we are running out of helium.
- - How do orcas communicate with each other?
  - They produce whistles, echolocation clicks, pulsed calls, low frequency pops, and jaw claps.
- - What is the difference between sexual selection and artificial selection?
  - Sexual selection a fitness of alleles determined by mating success not environment, artificial selection is when humans decide allele prevalence in population.

  - A buffalo would go by the large mammals such as a american black bear.
- - why are sound waves invisible?
  - sound waves aren't always invisible, if you see something vibrating you are seeing sound waves. but sound is simply the ordered vibration of matter, as opposed to heat, which is the disordered vibration of matter.
