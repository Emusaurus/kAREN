# kAREN

#### An implementation of [flask-chatterbot](https://github.com/chamkank/flask-chatterbot) for horrible people.

### Basically, imagine [Microsft's redpilled TAY AI](https://youtu.be/HsLup7yy-6I) running on your very own server!

## Local Setup:
 1. Ensure that Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, and ChatterBot are installed (either manually, or run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`).
 2. Run *app.py* with `sudo python3 app.py`. (Need root for running in port 80)
 3. The demo will be live at [http://localhost/](http://localhost/)

##Training file:
The training file for kAREN (her personality) is the file "db.sqlite3". This file is quite large and you will need a powerful server in order to have faster responses. WARNING: The responses are pretty horrible!

## License
This source is free to use, but ChatterBot does have a license which still applies and can be found on the [LICENSE](https://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot/blob/master/LICENSE) page.
